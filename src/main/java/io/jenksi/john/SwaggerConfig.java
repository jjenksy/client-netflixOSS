/**
 * Created by johnjenkins on 7/17/17.
 * Swagger 2 is enabled through the @EnableSwagger2 annotation.
 * After the Docket bean is defined, its select() method returns an instance of ApiSelectorBuilder, which provides a way to control the endpoints exposed by Swagger.
 * Predicates for selection of RequestHandlers can be configured with the help of RequestHandlerSelectors and PathSelectors. Using any() for both will make documentation for your entire API available through Swagger.
 * This configuration is enough to integrate Swagger 2 into existing Spring Boot project. For other Spring projects, some additional tuning is required.
